<p class="p7"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt; The Magical Forest &lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt; In a faraway land, there lived two<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>witches named Rosetta and Zita. Rosetta was an orphan and had never seen her parents. She grew up in the “Magical Forest” and considered it her paramount duty to protect this forest from all evil powers. Zita too was an orphan who held a grudge against everyone since she did not have a happy childhood. Both Rosetta and Zita were bestowed with magical powers for protecting the “Magical Forest”, but they used their powers differently. Rosetta used it for the benefit of others while Zita used it to fulfil her selfish desires. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Usually Zita and Rosetta patrolled the forest together, but one day they decided to take different paths to cover more ground. After Rosetta went into the forest, Zita followed her, as she suspected Rosetta of letting go non-magique people. Rosetta saw a young boy stealing rare diamonds that are impossible to break. She commanded, ”Keep the diamonds back from where you took them and go back to where you belong.” The boy retorted, ”Why should I?” Rosetta responded, ” These diamonds can cause enormous harm to the forest with the night strikes from the dragons. The dragons are very sensitive to rare diamonds and any change in the position of these diamonds can attract the fury of these dragons. Now would you mind putting the diamonds back.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The boy sighed. He kept the diamonds back and introduced himself. “By the way my name is Hector and you are?” said Hector. “Rosetta and I am a witch. Got it?” said Rosetta reluctantly. Perhaps, she wanted to scare the boy. “Yeah, so do you need any help in protecting the forest?” said Hector. Rosetta was taken aback by Hector’s confidence. She thought to herself, “How did Hector know that I needed help”. She replied hesitatingly, ”Yeah, I need a little help, but how did you know?” Hector smiled. ”I know because I hear poachers come hunting for rare and powerful dragons. Also, I know two people with magical powers. Do you want to know about them?” Rosetta was curious. “I am all ears,” said Rosetta.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hector revealed, ”My father is a wizard and my mother a witch.” Rosetta was ecstatic when she heard this. All this while she believed that Zita and herself were the only two keepers of magical powers. She asked, “Hmmm…So where is your brother, Hector?” Hector was quite excited to talk about his family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pointed to a far off castle and said, “In that castle. Do you want to come?” Rosetta was not expecting an invitation so soon. “Not now,” she said. Hector bade farewell to Rosetta and left. Rosetta did not know that her friend Zita was eavesdropping on their conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>&lt;h3&gt; The Castle &lt;/h3&gt;</b></span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;After Hector left, Zita came out of her hiding spot and yelled, “You are going to believe that non-magique person”. Rosetta retorted, “Why can’t I trust him? He told me that there were ---”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“More magical people. I know that. I overheard your conversation with that young boy Hector,” said Zita. Rosetta was furious. Zita went on “<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know it very well Rosetta that I don’t spare any non-magique person unlike you.” Rosetta scoffed. “You have broken my trust. I don’t trust you anymore. You are plain jealous of people with magical powers and I am not. Bye Zita.” Rosetta slammed the door, sat on her dragon, and went in search of Hector. After a brief search, she was able to locate Hector.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I would like to see your brother,” she smiled coldly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Back in the forest, Zita went in search of the Staff of Scallion, the second powerful staff in the magical world, that could be destroyed only by Diamond-Back Night Fury and Fire Scallion Dragon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hector took Rosetta to his father’s kingdom – the Kingdom of Aothera. In Aothera, Rosetta met James, the future king of Aothera and Hector’s elder brother. Rosetta enjoyed the company of James and Hector. They invited Rosetta to stay for few more days at the palace and Rosetta readily agreed. She completely forgot about Zita and the “Magical Forest”. James and Rosetta started spending a lot of time together. One beautiful morning, James held Rosetta’s hand and went on one knee to propose to her. Rosetta was elated and agreed to get married to James.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile in the forest, Zita’s twenty seven year search for the Staff of Scallion came to an end. She finally found the Staff and started strategizing to harm Rosetta.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aothera’s castle was getting ready for grand celebrations as the royal wedding date between Rosetta and James was fast approaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As soon as James and Rosetta had taken their marital vows, the Dark Side Monsters were unleashed from the Dark Side Lands a.k.a Forbidden<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mountains. Rosetta realised that this was the handiwork of Zita. Zita walked towards Rosetta and said, ”I warned you against trusting non-magique people, but you did not heed my advice. Now look what he has done. He has brought the Dark Side Monsters to ruin your wedding.” Rosetta scoffed, “You are lying because you never trusted and liked anyone. Not even me Zita.” James summoned the Dragons to scare the Dark Side Monsters since their weakness was fire. When Zita found out that the dragons were scaring her monsters, she told with an expression of absolute terror, “I will come back. Bye for now Rosetta” and disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">”What was that all about?” asked James with an angry look on his face. Hector told James how he met Rosetta and also told him about Zita’s magical powers.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>&lt;h3&gt; The Evil Curse &lt;/h3&gt;</b></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;After few years, the King of Aothera died and James was made the new King. Rosetta gave birth to a lovely child and decided to name him, Flynn Ryder Antrario. The entire kingdom came to celebrate the birth of Ryder. During the celebrations, Zita came to Aothera, took down all the guards and rushed to the party hall and told Rosetta, “I will harm the one closest to you.” She started casting her evil spells and cursed Ryder. ”On this child’s 16<sup>th</sup> birthday, he shall be paralysed and only a diamond and a cycloid scale of a Diamond Back Night Fury will end his curse. You will not succeed in stopping me, Rosetta. So don’t even try,” said Zita and she went away with an evil smile on her face. She instructed her army to prevent Rosetta from succeeding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After two years, Rosetta gave birth to another child, but this time she decided not to celebrate and used her magical powers to prevent Zita from entering her kingdom. She named her second son Robert Antario and hoped that one day he would become Ryder’s saviour. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;After 11 years, Robert made new friends, learned new spells and learned sword fighting. Rosetta and James did not tell Robert and Ryder about the curse and how to break it, because Rosetta and James<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>did not want to scare their sons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Robert woke up early and shouted, ” It is Ryder’s birthday today. It is Ryder’s birthday.” Robert went to his parent’s bedroom and shouted, ”It is Ryder’s birthday today. It is Ryder’s birthday.” Rosetta recollected Zita’s curse, “Today is Ryder’s 16<sup>th</sup> birthday and he will be paralysed until someone gets the cycloid scale and a diamond of a Diamond Back Night Fury.” When Robert reached Ryder’s room, he shouted, ”Wake up. It is your birthday today. It is your birthday.” No matter how loud Robert shouted, Ryder wouldn’t wake up. Robert was totally perplexed. He rushed to Rosetta and asked, ”Why isn’t Ryder waking up? It is his 16<sup>th</sup> birthday today. I tried everything to wake him up.” He was visibly upset.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rosetta gasped and became really sad. She reminded James about the curse and he looked dejected. Robert became restless and suspicious that his parents were hiding something from him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He asked, ”Why are you sad? Is there something that I need to know?” James and Rosetta explained everything to Robert.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Robert looked sad, but soon regained his composure. He stood up bravely and told, ”I will help my brother Ryder. No matter how difficult it is to get the cycloid scale and a diamond from the Diamond Back Night Fury, I will do whatever it takes.” Rosetta was in two minds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>”You can’t go, you will hurt yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And by the way Zita and her army of Torment Blazers will do anything to stop you,” said Rosetta.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>”I don’t care, but I am not alone. I have friends to help me,” remarked Robert and rushed to his room.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p12"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Robert started packing for the perilous journey and Rosetta came to his room and warned Robert once again, “Be careful Robert”. He sighed and told, “I will be careful. Don’t worry.” He then rushed to his friends’ house to seek their help for his new adventure. Both Jennifer and Carlos readily agreed to help him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trio – Robert, Jennifer and Carlos embarked on their most important mission of saving the future king of Aothera. On the way, they came across a river that was flowing with full force that it was impossible to row a boat so they used the spell Intrigo Rock Bridge to cross the river. Then they reached the four cross a.k.a Death Cross because one mistake could cost anyone their life. It was getting dark and they had to take some rest. They took the left most path which led them to the gorge where they set their camp.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Next morning, they used the Intrigo Rock Bridge spell to cross the gorge and then the bridge broke and fell. “That was close,” exclaimed Carlos. Jennifer and Robert pulled Carlos back behind a huge rock. Carlos told, “What are you doing Jennifer? Why did you …?” “Torment Blazers!” interrupted Jennifer. Robert and Carlos gasped.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;“They almost saw us and that’s the reason I pulled you back,” said Jennifer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the Torment Blazers told, “I thought I heard something behind that huge rock. Let’s check it out.” Robert shouted, “Run!”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trio ran to a nearby place which was an old house. The Torment Blazers shot spells at them. One of the spells hit Robert’s bag which contained the map Rosetta gave him. Carlos was startled. He told, ” We have to get Robert’s bag at all cost. We are helpless without it.” “Yes we are, but if we go back to get the map, we will be in more trouble,” said Jennifer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trio reached the house and heaved a sigh of relief. “Why were they trying to kill us? They should only stop us, not kill us,” said Jennifer. “I don’t know, but do not want to know either,” said Carlos. Robert being the hard-core optimist told, ”Guys, on the bright side we reached this house safe and sound. We are lucky.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was already afternoon and they were very hungry so they feasted on the lip-smacking food that Carlos brought. They were so hungry that there was complete silence while they were eating. After lunch, they were back on their trail. It was a long and narrow path. By evening, they reached a treehouse and set the camp there. Next day before sun rise, they were back on the trail to finish the last lap of their mission. By dawn, they reached the mountain where Diamond Back Night Fury lived. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;When the trio reached the canyon to find the Diamond Back Night Fury, they saw the Torment Blazers with their map. Robert said, “We must duel for the spot otherwise we will never succeed. Who is with me?” Jennifer agreed spontaneously. Carlos was a bit hesitant. “Do we have to do it?” he asked Jennifer. Robert replied, “No pain. No gain.” Carlos agreed, “Fine then, I am with you.” He regretted his decision. They all moved out of their hiding spot and started shooting spells at the Torment Blazers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The abominable duel between Torment Blazers and the trio woke up the malevolent Fire Scallion Dragon. The dragon was a massive dragon with supernatural powers. It flew to the spot of the duel and started breathing out large amount of fire which burned down all the trees to ashes. The trio was totally scared. They had nowhere to hide, so Jennifer used her magical powers to calm down the Fire Scallion Dragon and narrated their story.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dragon calmed down, but continued to attack the Torment Blazers. The Torment Blazers had a narrow escape. The Fire Scallion Dragon was impressed with the bravery of the trio and became friends with them. The trio thanked the dragon profusely and continued their journey with their new friend. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt; After walking few miles, the trio reached the cave of the Three Tail Stinger Dragon. The dragon came out of the cave and changed its form to a ball and then when it landed on the ground, it aimed its three tails at the trio. The Fire Scallion Dragon protected the trio and challenged the Three Tail Stinger Dragon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before the challenge could commence, Carlos used his power to calm down the Three Tail Stinger as it led them to the other defences of the mountain. The first defence was spear shooting. Robert and Carlos huffed and closed their eyes, but Jennifer rushed to the defence stating that she knew how to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>deactivate it. When Robert and Carlos opened their eyes, Jennifer had already deactivated the first defence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trio walked calmly until the Three Tail Stinger led them to the Diamond Back Night Fury. When they went deep into the canyon, the Diamond Back Night Fury suddenly showed up. It roared very loudly and the Fire Scallion Dragon and the Three Tail Stinger did not stand a chance against the might of the Diamond Back Night Fury. Now the trio were on their own. The Diamond Back Night Fury started breathing lightning fire at the trio. Carlos screamed, ”We are doomed!”. Jennifer and Carlos hid behind a huge rock. Robert didn’t hide anywhere, but rushed towards Diamond Back Night Fury and used his magic to calm it down. His magic worked and the dragon became friends with the trio. It told the trio to call back the Fire Scallion Dragon and the Three Tail Stinger.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trio shared the purpose of their quest with Diamond Back Night Fury. The dragon wanted to help them and decided to give its scale and diamond. “It is going to be a long way home,” said Jennifer. The dragons offered them a ride home. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;When the trio reached the castle, Robert went directly to his brother’s room. Rosetta and James were already there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They were thrilled to see Robert alive. They hugged him. Rosetta used her magic to make the magical potion using the scale and the diamond. When Zita came to know that Robert succeeded in his mission, she was furious. She reached the castle and accosted Rosetta, “How did he succeed? No one has ever taken the scale and diamond from the Diamond Back Night Fury. Well, it is just the beginning. I will take my revenge Rosetta.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After Zita disappeared, Rosetta was in deep thought as she put the potion on Ryder’s lips. She was wondering how to stop Zita from taking revenge. Even before she could find an answer, she realised Ryder’s curse was broken.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After few seconds, Ryder yawned and told cheerfully, “Good morning everyone.” Everyone had a hearty laugh. Ryder questioned, “What did I miss?” He was thoroughly confused. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
